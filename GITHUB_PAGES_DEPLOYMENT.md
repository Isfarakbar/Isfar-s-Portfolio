## Method 3: Custom Domain (Optional - Requires Purchased Domain)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Custom domains must be properly formatted and purchased from a domain registrar.

**❌ Invalid formats:**
- `isfarportfolio` (missing domain extension)
- `portfolio` (not a valid domain)
- `mysite` (incomplete domain)

**✅ Valid formats:**
- `isfarportfolio.com`
- `isfar-portfolio.org`
- `yourname.dev`

### Step 1: Purchase Domain
- Buy a **real domain** from registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
- Examples: `yourname.com`, `yourportfolio.dev`, `isfar.io`

### Step 2: Configure DNS
Add these DNS records in your domain registrar's control panel:
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: YOUR-USERNAME.github.io
```

### Step 3: Add Custom Domain
1. In repository settings → Pages
2. Add your **purchased domain** in "Custom domain" field
3. Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

### Alternative: Use GitHub Pages Default URL (Free)
If you don't want to purchase a domain, your portfolio will be available at:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/portfolio
```
This is completely free and professional!
